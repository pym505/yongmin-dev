I am a backend-focused full-stack engineer with over 8 years of experience.  
(While I also have about 5 years of experience in frontend development, it mainly involved maintaining and integrating legacy systems.)

My strengths include system architecture design, data modeling, infrastructure setup, and large-scale data processing.  
I have consistently proposed and implemented practical solutions while adapting to evolving requirements.

This portfolio contains both technical documentation and personal reflections, including system designs I have implemented in real-world projects.  
It also includes retrospectives on my career transition and life in Japan.

Earlier in my career, I worked for a top-tier enterprise in South Korea, but I made a deliberate choice to leave that path to deepen my hands-on technical expertise.  
Through freelance and startup work, I gained direct experience designing and operating production-grade systems.  
These experiences led to tangible outcomes, including surpassing the compensation levels of many former colleagues in the corporate sector.  
Currently, I’m based in Japan, focusing on long-term career growth in an environment that values both autonomy and sustainability.
