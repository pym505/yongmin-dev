**1. Why did you move to Japan?**  
Please refer to “Why I Moved to Japan” for a detailed explanation.

**2. Why did you leave your previous companies?**

Samsung Electronics – Semiconductor Division  
The department I worked in was operating on outdated technologies and followed a seniority-based evaluation system. Individual performance was difficult to recognize. I left to pursue more technical growth, knowing that freelance work could offer similar compensation.

ShareKim  
The job was originally offered with remote work as a key condition. However, the required number of office days gradually increased, eventually leading to a request for full on-site work. Although a freelance option with remote work was proposed, the change in terms made it difficult to expect long-term stability.

Citibank  
This was a short-term project that required in-office work. It ended as planned without extension.

Linus  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients defaulted on payments, which affected the company financially. At the same time, I was preparing to relocate to Japan, so I decided to leave to focus on that transition.

Docenty AI  
This was a part-time contract. Before moving to Japan, I worked more than expected, but after relocating, my availability became limited. As a result, there was a mismatch in expectations, and I decided to accept a better offer from another company.

Kaisyo (current)  
The initial salary offer was less than half of my previous full-time salary in Korea, but I joined under the promise of a potential raise and remote work. As of now, remote work remains uncertain, and the salary may remain fixed, so I am currently reconsidering my options.

**3. What were your criteria when choosing companies?**

ShareKim: Offered remote work, which aligned with my goal of eventually working abroad. My technical stack also needed updating at the time.  
Citibank: The office was within walking distance of my home.  
Linus: Allowed full remote work, even while I was living in Japan for six months.  
Docenty AI: Enabled me to continue job searching in Japan while working part-time. I was also interested in the AI-related technologies.  
ResponseOne: Provided a rare opportunity to work part-time on infrastructure projects while living abroad.  
Kaisyo: Based in rural Japan and involved service development for a subsidiary company. It was one of the few companies that accepted applicants without Japanese language certification or recruitment agency referrals.

**4. What kind of company are you looking for?**

I am capable of building MVP-level backend systems from scratch — including cloud infrastructure, database design, API development, and data pipelines. My contributions in this area have been recognized with compensation exceeding 100 million KRW (approximately 75,000–80,000 USD), which placed me in the top percentile among Korean developers in their early 30s.

However, I would like to gain more hands-on experience managing large-scale enterprise systems. My infrastructure knowledge comes from a backend engineering perspective rather than a dedicated operations role, and I am eager to deepen my expertise.

I am also interested in working in the AI domain, as I believe AI will shape the future of our industry.

Lastly, I have loved games since I was a child, and I would be excited to work on game-related projects if the opportunity arises.

**5. Final Note**

Through diverse work environments, I have developed a strong sense of both my capabilities and areas for growth. I am now looking to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully and grow together over the long term — with trust, technical depth, and stability.

Above all, I hope to find a company in Japan where I can stay and grow long-term. I am particularly interested in roles related to cloud infrastructure, backend architecture, database systems, AI technologies, and game-related development.
