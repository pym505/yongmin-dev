**2. Why did you leave your previous companies?**

Samsung Electronics – Semiconductor Division  
The department I worked in was operating on outdated technologies and followed a seniority-based evaluation system. Individual performance was difficult to recognize. I left to pursue more technical growth, knowing that freelance work could offer similar compensation.

ShareKim  
The job was originally offered with remote work as a key condition. However, the required number of office days gradually increased, eventually leading to a request for full on-site work. the change in terms made it difficult to expect long-term stability.

Citibank  
This was a short-term project that required in-office work. It ended as planned without extension.

Linus  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients defaulted on payments, which affected the company financially. At the same time, I was preparing to relocate to Japan, so I decided to leave to focus on that transition.

Docenty AI  
This was a part-time contract. Before moving to Japan, I worked more than expected, but after relocating, my availability became limited. As a result, there was a mismatch in expectations, and I decided to accept a better offer from another company.

Kaisyo  
The initial salary offer was less than half of my previous full-time salary in Korea, but I joined under the promise of a potential raise and remote work. As of now, remote work remains uncertain, and the salary may remain fixed, so I am currently reconsidering my options.

**3. What were your criteria when choosing companies?**

ShareKim: Offered remote work, which aligned with my goal of eventually working abroad. My technical stack also needed updating at the time.  
Citibank: The office was within walking distance of my home.  
Linus: Allowed full remote work, even while I was living in Japan for six months.  
Docenty AI: Enabled me to continue job searching in Japan while working part-time. I was also interested in the AI-related technologies.  
ResponseOne (sidejob)  : Provided a rare opportunity to work part-time on infrastructure projects while living abroad.  
Kaisyo : Based in rural Japan and involved service development for a subsidiary company. It was one of the few companies that accepted applicants without Japanese language certification or recruitment agency referrals.

**4. Final Note**

Through diverse work environments, I have developed a strong sense of both my capabilities and areas for growth. I am now looking to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully and grow together over the long term — with trust, technical depth, and stability.

Above all, I hope to find a company in Japan where I can stay and grow long-term. I am particularly interested in roles related to cloud infrastructure, backend architecture, database systems, AI technologies, and game-related development.
