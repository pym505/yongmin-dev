**My goal is simple:**  
To build a happy family and live a stable life.  
But I realized that in Korea, achieving that goal has become increasingly difficult.  
**That’s why I chose Japan.**

---

**1. Real Estate in Korea Is Too Expensive**  
Even in the countryside, new apartments cost over **500 million KRW**.  
In Seoul, prices range from **700 million to over 1 billion**.  
Taking out a **400 million KRW loan** means paying around **2 million KRW per month**, with a **4% interest rate**.  
In contrast, **Japan offers much lower housing costs and interest rates**, especially for older properties.

**2. Society Makes It Hard to Build a Family**  
Korea's unmarried rate is **90% for people in their 20s** and **50% for those in their 30s**.  
Its birthrate is the **world’s lowest at 0.75**.  
Due to intense competition and high educational costs, raising a child is **1.5 to 2 times more expensive than in Japan**.  
But it’s not just about money — there are **deeper social issues** that are harder to put into words.

**3. Stability of Employment**  
The average job tenure in Korea is **7 years**; in Japan, it’s **13 years**.  
The job-to-applicant ratio is **0.3 in Korea** compared to **1.25 in Japan**.  
That means when **10 people apply for jobs, only 3 positions are available in Korea**.  
Wage arrears are also **nearly 100 times more common** in Korea.  
Even when you get a job, **trust and security are lacking**.

---

**4. Economic Instability**  
Korea relies heavily on exports (**40% of GDP**) and has a weak domestic market.  
It has a strong manufacturing base, but **little differentiation**.  
**China is rapidly catching up**.  
(While working at Samsung, I **witnessed firsthand the transfer of core technologies**.)  
**High wages + low tech competitiveness = long-term structural risk.**

In contrast, **Japan has strong domestic demand and solid industrial foundations** — particularly in **materials, precision machinery, and core components**.


**5. That’s Why I Chose Japan**  
In Korea, you have to spend so much energy just to survive.  
Considering the pressures of **work, parenting, housing, and future uncertainty**,  
I believed that **relocating to another country — no matter how hard — was the better choice**.

Japan isn’t perfect, but it’s **close to Korea** and **culturally accessible**.  
For someone looking to build a **stable life and raise a family**,  
I judged that **Japan offered a better long-term environment**.
