# My Personal Definition of Leadership, Built Through Experience

> **Under a perfect leader, team members shrink back — and the leader burns out.
> In contrast, a leader who shows their flaws gives the team the confidence to speak up.**

## 1. Introduction: Why I Wrote This

A business partner I worked with once asked,
"Yongmin, how do you manage collaboration within your team?"

While I haven't held many formal leadership titles, I’ve worked through client-side coordination, backend team management, and cross-functional communication as a freelancer.
This isn’t a summary of textbook leadership theory — it’s a collection of what I’ve learned on the ground, through direct experience.

## 2. Moments I Faced as a Leader

* **ShareKim**: Served as backend team lead, overseeing system architecture and task allocation
* **Linus**: Took on both PM and senior engineer roles, balancing development and external coordination
* **ResponseOne (side work)**: Led sprints, technical decision-making, and code review standards as a tech lead

## 3. How I Define Leadership: A Role That Provides Direction and Standards

* A leader should provide structure and clear standards, not just answers.
* You don’t need to be better than your team in every area. Over-perfection often intimidates.
* A good meeting is one where the team speaks more than the lead.
* Trust is earned not through talk, but through tangible outcomes.

## 4. Failures and Lessons: What I Struggled with as a Leader

### 1) Failing to Empathize with a Burned-Out Team Member

At ShareKim, one team member was deeply burned out. At the time, I didn’t know how to empathize.
But I didn’t ignore it. I made time — walking, chatting about unrelated topics, one hour at a time.
Eventually, the person re-engaged with the project, and to this day, I still keep in touch with some of the team.

### 2) Tension with a Highly Credentialed Junior

One junior with a strong pedigree openly challenged me.
I responded by being honest about what I didn’t know — and letting results speak for themselves.
Without needing to argue, he changed his attitude and remained respectful toward me.

### 3) Negotiating with Clients

Client requirements change — always. So I treat initial plans as mutable.
By assuming a “full power” state and then adding 50% buffer, I get a realistic schedule.
On several occasions, I proposed ideas the client hadn’t considered, and it left a strong impression.

## 5. Team Management Principles: Build Flow, Not Just Agreement

### Break Silence with Incomplete Thoughts

I often start meetings with half-finished ideas.
This encourages team members to step up and suggest improvements.
Once one person speaks, I guide the others to share as well.

### Talk Beyond Work

Not every conversation needs to be work-related.
Jokes, hobbies, and casual talk break down barriers and build trust.
Empathy isn't mandatory — presence and time are enough.

### Show Your Flaws, Not Just Your Strengths

Leaders who always look strong often stifle feedback.
Saying “I’m not sure,” or “I don’t know yet” gives your team room to step forward.
You don’t need to understand everything — structure your team so that information flows up.

### Factor in Energy and Strengths

People aren’t always operating at 100%.
Flexibility and buffer allow better outcomes. Ask what your team prefers or excels at — and work around that.

## 6. Conclusion: The Kind of Leader I Want to Be

I want to be a light-touch leader.
Someone who works with great people, collects their outcomes, and steers direction — without pretending to be invincible.
I want to keep writing code, stay grounded, and maintain my own rhythm.
Because when I’m working in a way that feels right to me, the team benefits too.
