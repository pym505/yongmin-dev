# Coming Soon

I'm currently working on documenting this project with the following sections:

## Project Overview
- Purpose and key requirements
- Challenges of large-scale web crawling

## Technology Stack
- Docker containerization
- Selenium automation
- Dynamic instance management

## Process Flow
- Crawling workflow diagram
- Scaling logic and triggers

## Infrastructure Setup
- Architecture diagram
- Instance scaling and termination strategy
- Resource optimization approach

This system was implemented during my previous work engagement. Documentation is being prepared with appropriate confidentiality considerations.

Check back for updates, or contact me if you have specific questions about this architecture.
