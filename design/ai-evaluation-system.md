# Coming Soon

I'm currently working on documenting this AI system architecture with the following sections:

## Project Overview
- Purpose and design principles
- Challenges in reliable AI response generation

## System Components
- Evaluation prompt engineering
- Lightweight model distribution mechanism
- Response quality assessment framework
- Optimal response selection algorithm

## Process Flow
- Parallel query distribution workflow
- Evaluation and scoring methodology
- Decision-making process for response selection

## Architecture Design
- System diagram
- Efficiency and resource optimization
- Scalability considerations

This system was implemented during my previous work engagement. Documentation is being prepared with appropriate confidentiality considerations.

Check back for updates, or contact me if you have specific questions about this architecture.
